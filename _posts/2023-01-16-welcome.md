Welcome to this semester's offering of the Programming Interactive Computer Graphics and Games at the University of Minnesota!  The following describes the various tools we will be using this semester:

- The [course website](https://csci-4611-fall-2022.github.io/) will be your main access point for public course information and content, such as the syllabus, schedule, and links to various external resources.
- [Canvas](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/355329) will be used for posting grades and internal course content, include lecture videos and slides.
- Programming assignments will be posted on [GitHub](https://github.com/CSCI-4611-Spring-2023).  We will be using GitHub classroom for checking out and submitting assignment code.
- [Piazza](https://piazza.com/umn/fall2022/csci4611) will be used for posting questions about the course and will be closely monitored by the TAs.  This is the primary communication platform for help on programming assignments.

If you have any questions about the course structure, please review the [syllabus](/syllabus) first and then feel free to contact me if the answer is not already posted there.
