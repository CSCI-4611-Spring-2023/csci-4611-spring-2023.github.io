#### Group Study Session

Each week, Frank will hold a group study session that is open to all students. They will go over some of the theory behind what is taught and will be available to answer questions or go into further detail.  You do not need to schedule an appointment in advance.
- **Wednesdays** from 5-6pm in Keller 2-209.


#### Individual Meetings with TAs

- [**Public Calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19wb2Z1djljc2dwZDU0YW1iaWxvcmNoNXU5Z0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t). You can check this calendar see the time blocks for each TA before you make an appointment.
- [**Online Appointment System**](https://csci4611.youcanbook.me).  Please use this to schedule a virtual meeting during TA office hours.  We generally try to provide coverage at various times throughout the day.

#### Individual Meetings with the Professor

- [**Meeting Request Form**](https://forms.gle/5iMyrHdrgmwmcYSE9). I am also happy to meet with students directly. However, please note that my schedule does tend to be very full, so these meetings should primarily be used for questions that need to be discussed with me specifically and cannot be addressed by the TAs. To request a meeting with me, please specify a few potential timeslots using this form, and I will send you a meeting invitation.
