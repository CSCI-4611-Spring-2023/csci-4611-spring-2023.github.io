#### Group Study Session

Each week, Frank will hold a 2-hour group study session, which will be scheduled soon. They will go over some of the theory behind what is taught, and will be available to answer questions or go into further detail.  These sessions are open to all, and you do not need to schedule an appointment in advance.


#### Individual Meetings with TAs

- [**Public Calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19wb2Z1djljc2dwZDU0YW1iaWxvcmNoNXU5Z0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t). You can check this calendar see the time blocks for each TA before you make an appointment.
- [**Online Appointment System**](https://csci4611.youcanbook.me).  Please use this to schedule a virtual meeting during TA office hours.  We generally try to provide coverage at various times throughout the day.

#### Individual Meetings with the Professor

- [**Online Appointment System**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ3vkTWj_UelImht1kmzKO_wPMA2fjFl3nEqH0oz-rEgINDbX5XmDQSShCmw-TCwuJ5ktfk9iNY1).  Please use this to schedule an in-person meeting with the instructor.  These time slots are limited, so they should primarily be used for questions that need to be discussed with me specifically and cannot be addressed by the TAs.  If there are no appointment slots available, please reach out to me directly, and I will be happy to schedule a meeting with you.
