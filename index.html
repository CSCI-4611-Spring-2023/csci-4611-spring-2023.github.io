<p>Computer graphics is an exciting field within computer science that has seen dramatic recent growth. The impact of graphics on our culture and on our daily lives is far-reaching, as we can see through applications in art, design, education, games, movies, science, and medicine. This course covers the tools and techniques used today for programming games and other interactive computer graphics applications. Some of the core concepts covered include: interactive 2D/3D graphics, physical simulation, polygonal modeling, texture mapping, character animation, illumination models, shader programming, and ray casting. This is a <b>programming-heavy</b> course, and assignments will be implemented in TypeScript using a high-level graphics toolkit built on top of WebGL. </p>
